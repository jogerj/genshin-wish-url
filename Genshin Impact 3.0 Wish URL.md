I found a less intrusive way to retrieve wish URL, involves reading from cache
1. Download and open [Chrome Cache View](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chromecacheview.zip)
2. Open your genshin folder and locate this folder: e.g.
C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact Game\GenshinImpact_Data\webCaches\Cache\Cache_Data
3. Ctrl-Q to open quick filter, look for gacha_info
4. Sort by Last Accessed
5. Right-click the URL cell and Copy Clicked Cell
6. Remove the 1/0/ in front of the URL
7. Post to paimon.moe as usual
